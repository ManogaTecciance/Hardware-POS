## 2026-08-04 — Phase 0 review

### D1 — `docs/restaurant-backend-plan.md` is superseded
Superseded as the implementation authority by the approved AxloPOS Restaurant POS
requirements. **Not deleted.** It carries a superseded notice and is retained as
historical documentation. Canonical documentation lives in `docs/restaurant-pos/`.

Its *engineering principles* were explicitly retained (additive-only migrations,
no vertical branching in shared modules, server-authoritative state, optimistic
concurrency, one junction point at "closing a session produces a `Sale`",
menu ≠ catalog). Its *data model* and *gating model* were not.

### D2 — Exchanges
The audit confirmed the repository contains an Exchange **A4 document renderer**
but **no** Exchange transaction, Prisma model, migration, API module, route,
permission key, or E2E spec.

Therefore:
- Preserve the existing Exchange document renderer and its current rendering output.
- Keep regression coverage for that renderer.
- Reserve the `EXCHANGES` module key.
- Hide `EXCHANGES` for Restaurant tenants.
- **Do not represent Exchanges as a fully implemented transaction feature.**
- Mark future Exchange transaction test cases `Blocked — feature not implemented`.
- Do not create an Exchange transaction workflow during Phase 1.
- Exchanges remain part of the shared platform for Tile Shop and Hardware tenants;
  Exchange code, structures, permissions, and tests must not be removed.

### D3 — `ModuleKey` enum values are stable database identifiers
The persisted values are fixed as listed in
[`01-platform-architecture.md`](./01-platform-architecture.md). They must not be
renamed without an explicit, approved data-migration strategy.

### D4 — Production database and staging
There is **no approval to run migrations against the live Tile Shop production
database.**

Phase 1 development may use a local disposable PostgreSQL, a seeded test
database, or an isolated integration-test database.

Required before any production migration or deployment:
- a production backup;
- a tested restore process;
- a staging environment or sanitized restorable production snapshot;
- a migration dry run;
- regression tests;
- a rollback or forward-fix plan.

The absence of staging **must not** block local implementation. It **must** block
production migration and deployment. Additive migrations only.

### D5 — Integration-test harness: approved
Requirements: tests must never connect to production; add protection against
production-like database URLs; tests must be repeatable; test data isolated and
cleaned; reuse existing test architecture where practical; keep the local
developer workflow understandable.

### D6 — Printing
Initial physical target: **80 mm network ESC/POS thermal printer.** The
architecture must also support a mock printer adapter, browser/system print
fallback, multiple station printers, and future USB or Bluetooth adapters.

**Printer-specific code must not live inside restaurant order-domain services.**

### D7 — Real-time transport
Use **WebSockets** via a NestJS-compatible architecture, preferably **Socket.IO**
unless repository analysis identifies a strong reason otherwise.

REST/database state is the source of truth. Every real-time screen must
resynchronise after reconnecting.

> Engineering note: Socket.IO across multiple API replicas requires a shared
> adapter (e.g. `@socket.io/redis-adapter`), because rooms and broadcasts are
> per-process. If replicas and WebSockets are both intended, Redis becomes a hard
> dependency at Phase 4. Decide "Redis: yes or no" before Phase 4, not during it.

### D8 — Service charge and tax
Service-charge tax treatment must be **tenant-configurable**. Do not hard-code one
tax interpretation. **Default service charge to disabled until configured.** Final
restaurant-specific tax configuration will be confirmed with an accountant before
production deployment.

### D9 — Uber Eats and PickMe Food
No production partner accounts, sandbox credentials, or final private API
documentation are assumed. Build the generic Online Orders Integration Hub and the
Mock Delivery Adapter first. **Do not claim production Uber Eats or PickMe support**
until official access, documentation, testing, and certification are complete.

### D10 — Multi-branch stock
`Product.quantityOnHand` not being branch-scoped is a **known architectural defect**
for local multi-branch inventory, and is **not an acceptable permanent limitation.**

Introduce a branch-scoped model (`BranchInventory` / `InventoryBalance`).
**Preserve `Product.quantityOnHand`** initially for backward compatibility and
QuickBooks caching. Do not destructively remove or repurpose it.

Scheduled as **Phase 2.5** — after branch scoping (Phase 2), before table sessions
(Phase 5). Rationale in [`phase-01-plan.md`](./phase-01-plan.md).

### D11 — Multiple API replicas
Assume the system may run with more than one API replica. **Do not depend on
process-local cache state for correctness.**

### D12 — README
Approved to correct the materially false project-status line. Factual and concise.

### D13 — Shared `UserRole` enum drift
The shared package's `UserRole` had 3 values against the database's 5. Align
**additively** (add missing keys, rename nothing, no database enum change) and add
a parity test that fails on future drift.

### D14 — `package-lock.json`
The repository is pnpm-based. The stray `package-lock.json` may be removed only
after confirming no CI, deployment, or tooling process depends on it.

> Verified 2026-08-04: no `.github/` directory exists (there is no CI);
> `amplify.yml` uses `npm install -g pnpm@10.33.0` then `pnpm install
> --frozen-lockfile` (a global install ignores the lockfile);
> `apps/api/Dockerfile` copies only `pnpm-lock.yaml`; no reference in
> `docker-compose*.yml`, `.dockerignore`, or `Caddyfile`. Removed in Slice 0 and
> added to `.gitignore` so it cannot return.

### D15 — Production migration gate: approved
The production API container **must not** automatically run Prisma migrations on
every startup.

- Development migrations use an explicit developer command.
- Integration tests may migrate a disposable test database.
- `RUN_MIGRATIONS_ON_BOOT` defaults to **false** in production.
- Production deployment runs migrations as a **separate one-off step before**
  starting or updating application replicas.
- The explicit migration command is documented in the deployment runbook.
- **Do not execute any migration against the live production database.**

### D16 — Test clarification
Existing behavioural assertions and production regression scenarios must remain
**unchanged**. Test infrastructure, configuration, fixtures, and shared utilities
may be extended as required for the integration-test harness. **Do not weaken or
remove existing coverage.**

### D17 — Tenant isolation
A repeated (100/100) isolation test is useful but **not sufficient alone**. Also
required:

- deterministic service/repository tenant scoping;
- cross-tenant negative integration tests;
- backend permission enforcement;
- branch isolation where applicable;
- **no trust in a request-supplied `tenantId`**;
- tenant identity derived from authenticated server-side context;
- database constraints and indexes where appropriate.

### D18 — Phase 1 implementation authorisation
Slices 0-3 approved for implementation. Slice 4 and later require separate
approval. Explicitly not authorised yet: provider ports; refactoring sales,
returns, or product logic; any restaurant domain feature (tables, menus, KOT,
takeaway, billing, integrations).

## 2026-08-04 — Slice 3.5 review

### D19 — Workspace-first authentication (resolves Risk J)
`Tenant.slug` is the **canonical public workspace identifier**.

Browser login will support either a `workspace` field on the login form, or a
tenant-specific URL such as `/login?workspace=<tenant-slug>`. A tenant subdomain
may be supported later. Full rationale and the target contract are in
[`08-authentication-and-workspace-identity.md`](./08-authentication-and-workspace-identity.md).

Target email/password contract:

```json
{ "workspace": "restaurant-name", "email": "user@example.com", "password": "..." }
```

Backward-compatibility rule:
- `workspace` supplied → authenticate **only** inside that tenant.
- `workspace` omitted **and exactly one** active tenant account matches → the
  existing login may continue **temporarily**.
- `workspace` omitted **and several** match → reject with a generic
  `WORKSPACE_REQUIRED` response.

Prohibited:
- **No searchable tenant dropdown.**
- **Do not reveal tenant names from an email address.**
- **Do not return the matching tenant names.**
- **Do not indicate how many tenants matched.**
- **Do not expose whether the email exists in another tenant.**
- No tenant enumeration through login error responses.

PIN authentication remains explicitly scoped through the appropriate tenant,
branch, and register context.

The browser workspace-login **user interface** belongs to the frontend
modularisation phase (Slice 8). Slice 4 must not become an authentication UI
redesign.

### D20 — Authentication throttling is a release gate (Risk K)
Throttling stays in **Slice 7** and is now a **mandatory gate** before public
staging, internet-accessible demonstrations, pilot deployment, and production
deployment.

Slice 7 must protect at least `POST /auth/login`, `POST /auth/pin-login`, and
refresh-token abuse where appropriate. The design must consider: source IP;
tenant/workspace; normalised email or login identifier; branch/register context
for PIN login; a generic HTTP 429; `Retry-After`; account-enumeration safety;
proxy-aware client IP handling; multiple API replicas; and a
distributed-compatible limiter or infrastructure-level rate limiting with an
application backstop.

**Do not implement throttling during Slice 4.** Do not make unrelated
authentication changes during Slice 4.

## Open decisions

| ID | Question | Needed by |
|---|---|---|
| O1 | `mockSync()` fabricates QuickBooks document ids for a *disconnected Tile Shop tenant*, writing synthetic ids into financial records. Preserve, or change deliberately? | Phase 2 |
| O2 | Redis: yes or no? Determines the Socket.IO multi-replica adapter (D7, D11) and the settings-cache invalidation strategy. | Phase 4 |
| O3 | Service-charge tax treatment specifics, to be confirmed with an accountant (D8). | Phase 8 |
| O4 | Pilot restaurant: which tenant, how many branches, which printers, which channels. | Phase 4 |
| O5 | Commercial model (per-branch / per-register / per-module) — blocks subscription and entitlement design. | before entitlements |
